# abm-operations
ABM Operations!

1.Create a MySQL database named "abmoperations_db"

2.'npm install' (both client and server)

3.'npm start' (both client and server)

(client at http://localhost:3000 & server at http://localhost:3010)

Register/Log In totally functional server side, with some issues on client side:

1.Register

2.Log In

3.No Log Out for the moment. In order to Log In with different credentials, simply go back to http://localhost:3000/login

(I'll be finishing the register/login/logout + routes (protection) + DB improvements + JWT soon)
